# File Upload Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `vault_items` table to store all uploaded content
- Fields: id, userId, type, contentUrl, text, title, category, tags, summary, createdAt, updatedAt
- Supports types: image, video, voice, note, link

### 2. Backend API

#### New Files Created:
- **`/lib/upload-file.ts`**: Generalized file upload utility
  - Supports all file types (image, video, voice)
  - Handles content-type detection
  - Maintains backward compatibility with old `uploadImageAssets` function

- **`/app/api/upload/route.ts`**: New unified upload endpoint
  - Handles all file types (image, video, voice, note, link)
  - Validates MIME types and file sizes
  - Requires authentication
  - Stores metadata in database
  - Returns uploaded item data

- **`/app/api/vault-items/route.ts`**: API to fetch and delete vault items
  - GET: Fetch all user's vault items (with optional filtering)
  - DELETE: Delete a specific item

#### Updated Files:
- **`/app/api/upload-image/route.ts`**: Updated to use new `uploadFile` function
  - Maintains backward compatibility for existing image upload page

### 3. Frontend Components

#### New Component:
- **`/components/upload/file-uploader.tsx`**: Reusable upload component
  - Beautiful UI with type selection
  - Handles all file types
  - File validation and progress feedback
  - Drag & drop support for files
  - Text input for notes and links
  - URL validation for links

#### Updated Pages:
- **`/app/home/page.tsx`**: 
  - Integrated new FileUploader component
  - Fetches real vault items from API
  - Displays uploaded items in grid
  - Shows loading states
  - Empty state with call-to-action

### 4. File Type Support

| Type  | Upload Method | Max Size | Validation |
|-------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Image | File upload  | 10MB     | MIME type check |
| Video | File upload  | 100MB    | MIME type check |
| Voice | File upload  | 25MB     | MIME type check |
| Note  | Text input   | N/A      | Required text |
| Link  | URL input    | N/A      | URL format validation |

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Home Page
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/home`
- You should see the vault interface

### 3. Test Each Upload Type

#### Test Image Upload:
1. Click the "+" button (floating action button)
2. Select "Image"
3. Choose an image file (jpg, png, gif, webp, svg)
4. Click "Upload Image"
5. Image should appear in the vault grid

#### Test Video Upload:
1. Click the "+" button
2. Select "Video"
3. Choose a video file (mp4, webm, mov, avi)
4. Click "Upload Video"
5. Video thumbnail should appear in the vault

#### Test Voice Upload:
1. Click the "+" button
2. Select "Voice"
3. Choose an audio file (mp3, wav, ogg, m4a)
4. Click "Upload Voice"
5. Voice icon should appear in the vault

#### Test Note:
1. Click the "+" button
2. Select "Note"
3. Enter a title (optional)
4. Enter note content
5. Click "Upload Note"
6. Note icon should appear in the vault

#### Test Link:
1. Click the "+" button
2. Select "Link"
3. Enter a title (optional)
4. Enter a valid URL (e.g., https://example.com)
5. Click "Upload Link"
6. Link icon should appear in the vault

### 4. Verify Database
- All uploads should be stored in the `vault_items` table
- Check that items are associated with the correct user
- Verify file URLs are accessible

## What Still Works

### Existing Image Upload Page
- `/app/dashboard/upload/page.tsx` still works
- Uses the updated upload utility
- Backward compatible with existing code

## Error Fixed

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error
**Problem**: `crypto.randomUUID()` not available in Node.js environment

**Solution**: Replaced with `nanoid()` which is already in dependencies
```typescript
// Before
id: crypto.randomUUID()

// After
import { nanoid } from "nanoid";
id: nanoid()
```
